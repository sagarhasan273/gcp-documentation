- Create and use custom images
- Enable firewall rules for external access

---

## Day-5: Cloud Storage – Buckets, Files, Datastore, Pub/Sub.

- Google Cloud Storage services
- Comaparison and difference between the services
- Focus on GCS: Create buckets, upload/download files
- Object versioning, lifecycle policies (coldline, nearline)
- Static website hosting with GCS
- Bucket permissions (fine-grained vs uniform)

Demo: GCS with Compute Engine VM
- Create a GCS Bucket and upload/download files.
- Use a Service Account to give secure, keyless access.
- Launch a Compute Engine VM with attached IAM role.
- Access GCS from inside the VM (read/write files).
- Learn project cleanup and what happens when a project is deleted.

---

## Day-6: VPC Networking – Subnets and Firewalls

- Default vs Custom VPC
- IP ranges, subnet planning (CIDRs)
- Configure firewall rules (SSH, HTTP)
- Network tags and internal communication

---

## Day-7: Load Balancing + Managed Instance Groups

- Create MIGs for autoscaling web servers
- Setup HTTP(S) Load Balancer with health checks
- Real-world HA example: App with 3 zones
- Add logging to monitor backend status

---

## Day-8: Private App on Custom VPC + Regional External HTTP(S) LB + Custom Domain (GoDaddy + Cloud DNS)

- What you’ll build (end-to-end)
  - A custom VPC with **public** and **private** subnets, plus a **proxy-only** subnet
  - A simple Python **Flask** app running on private VMs (no external IPs), managed by a **Managed Instance Group**
  - A **Regional External HTTP(S) Load Balancer** in the public tier
  - A public **Cloud DNS** zone mapped to a **GoDaddy** domain so the app is reachable via a friendly name
  - Outbound internet for private VMs via **Cloud NAT**
    
---

## Day-9: Google Cloud CLI Deep Dive

- Introduction to gcloud CLI and why DevOps engineers use it  
- Configure projects, regions, zones, and authentication  
- Create and manage resources (VMs, Buckets, Firewall rules) via CLI  
- Compare UI vs CLI for the same tasks  
- Real-world DevOps use case: automation with gcloud scripts  

---

## Day-10: Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) – Setup and Access

- Create a managed PostgreSQL DB
- Secure access from VM using private IP
- Manage DB users and backups
- Import/export database dumps

---

## Day-11: Docker on GCP – Containerizing Apps

- Install Docker on Compute Engine
- Write a simple javascript app and dockerize it
- Push image to DockerHub or Artifact Registry
- Run container in background with exposed port

---

## Day-12: Artifact Registry – Secure Image Storage

- Setup private container repositories on Google Cloud.
- Push/pull from GCP VM
- Image tagging and versioning strategy (dev, staging, prod)
- Clean-up policies and access control

---

## Day-13: Intro to Kubernetes + GKE  

- Kubernetes basics (pods, deployments, services)
- Understanding GKE
- GKE Autopilot mode
- Self hosted vs Managed Kubernetes clusters

---

## Day-14: Deploy a Real App on GKE

- Push your custom Docker app to Artifact Registry
- Deploy app using `Deployment.yaml` and `Service.yaml`
- Expose using LoadBalancer service
- Rolling update and rollback demo

---

## Day-15: Secrets Manager – Storing API Keys Safely

- Why not to hardcode passwords or tokens
- Store and access secrets securely
- IAM-based access control for secrets
- Rotate and audit access logs

---

## Day-16: Pub/Sub – Messaging Basics

- Use-case: Async processing in e-commerce
- Create topic and publish messages
- Push vs Pull subscriptions
- Connect Pub/Sub with Cloud Functions (preview)

---

## Day-17: Cloud Build – CI/CD 

- Setup Cloud Build with GitHub trigger
- Create `cloudbuild.yaml` file
- Auto-build Docker image and push to registry
